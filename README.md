## Recommendations 

Considering the increase last year, a more conservative increase might be crucial to avoid a hitting a price ceiling where demand starts to drop. An increase of 10-15% could test the market's response without risking a significant loss of customers.

#### Price Setting:

If the price in 2022 was $4.99, a 10% increase would make the new price about $5.49.
A 15% increase would set the price at ~$5.74.

#### Recommended Strategy:

* Market Analysis: conduct further research to better understand customer satisfaction, potential competitive changes, and the overall economic environment. This can guide whether leaning towards the lower or higher end of the suggested increase.
* Pricing Strategy: consider different pricing for casual vs registered users, as they may have different price sensitivities.
* Monitor and Adjust: implement new prices but be ready to adjust based on immediate customer feedback and sales data. Monitoring will allow you to fine-tune your pricing strategy without committing to a price that might turn out to be too high.
